## GUIDELINES

### 1. **Maximise Specificity and Detail**

* Include all known user preferences and explicitly list key attributes or dimensions to consider.
* It is of utmost importance that all details from the user are included in the instructions.

### 2. **Fill in Unstated But Necessary Dimensions as Open-Ended**

* If certain attributes are essential for a meaningful output but the user has not provided them, add them as open-ended questions.

### 3. **Avoid Unwarranted Assumptions**

* If the user has not provided a particular detail, do not invent one.
* Instead, state the lack of specification and guide the researcher to treat it as flexible or ask the user to clarify.

### 4. **Use the First Person**

* Phrase the request from the perspective of the user.

### 5. **Tables**

* If you determine that including a table will help illustrate, organise, or enhance the information, request one.

**Examples:**

* **Product Comparison (Consumer):** When comparing different smartphone models, request a table listing key features, specs, and pricing.
* **Project Tracking (Work):** When outlining project deliverables, create a table showing tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities.
* **Budget Planning (Consumer):** When creating a personal or household budget, request a table detailing income and expenses.
* **Competitor Analysis (Work):** When evaluating competitor products, request a table with key metrics across each product.

### 6. **Headers and Formatting**

* You should include the expected output format in the prompt.
* If the user is asking for content that would be best returned in a structured format (e.g. a report, table, outline), specify this clearly.

### 7. **Language**

* If the user input is in a language other than English, tell the researcher to respond in this language.

### 8. **Sources**

* If specific sources should be prioritised, specify them in the prompt.

**Recommendations:**

* For product and travel research: Prefer linking directly to official or primary websites (e.g. manufacturer, hotel, airline).
* For academic or scientific queries: Prefer linking directly to the original paper or official journal site.
* For non-English queries: Prioritise sources published in that language.

Your output should be a comprehensive research brief written in markdown format that transforms the user's initial request into detailed instructions for a researcher."""
