# File Permissions - Windows Compatibility

## Overview
Implement Windows permission model compatibility throughout the OneShot system.

## Problem Statement
- Current system assumes Unix permission model (rwx, chmod)
- Windows uses ACLs instead of simple permission bits
- Different file access patterns and restrictions
- Executable file handling differs between platforms

## Scope
### Files to Investigate
- [ ] `app/tool_services.py` - File access and creation
- [ ] `app/multimodal_processor.py` - File processing permissions
- [ ] All tools that create or modify files
- [ ] Temporary file creation logic
- [ ] Log file writing permissions

### Key Areas
1. **File Access Checking**
   - Replace Unix permission checks with Windows-compatible methods
   - Handle read/write/execute permission verification
   - Manage file locking differences
   
2. **File Creation**
   - Set appropriate permissions on created files
   - Handle Windows file attributes
   - Manage temporary file permissions
   
3. **Executable Files**
   - Windows executable detection (.exe, .bat, .ps1)
   - Execute permission handling
   - Script execution permissions

## Technical Requirements
- Use `os.access()` for cross-platform permission checking
- Implement Windows-specific permission utilities
- Handle file attribute differences
- Manage Windows file locking behavior

## Test Cases
- [ ] File permission checks work on Windows
- [ ] File creation sets correct permissions
- [ ] Executable detection functions properly
- [ ] Temporary files have appropriate access
- [ ] Log files can be written correctly

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Audit permission-related code
2. **Phase 2**: Create permission utility module
3. **Phase 3**: Replace Unix-specific permission code
4. **Phase 4**: Test permission handling on Windows

## Dependencies
- Path separator handling (subtask 01)

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Overly restrictive Windows permissions
  - **Mitigation**: Use least-privilege principle with fallback handling
- **Risk**: Antivirus interference with file operations
  - **Mitigation**: Implement retry logic and clear error messages

## Progress Log
| Date | Developer | Action | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 2025-08-24 | AI Agent | Created comprehensive test script | test_file_permissions.py - validates cross-platform permission handling |
| 2025-08-24 | AI Agent | Fixed Windows read-only cleanup issue | Added proper read-only attribute removal in test cleanup |
| 2025-08-24 | AI Agent | Ran file permission tests | 9/9 tests passed on Windows - file permissions work correctly |
| 2025-08-24 | AI Agent | Validated Windows file behavior | Executable detection, read-only handling, and ACL access confirmed |

## Troubleshooting Notes
### Common Issues
- Access denied errors on Windows
- File locking conflicts
- Antivirus blocking file operations
- Permission inheritance differences
