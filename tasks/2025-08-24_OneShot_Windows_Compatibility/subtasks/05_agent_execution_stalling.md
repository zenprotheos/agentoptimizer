# Agent Execution Stalling - Windows Compatibility

## Overview
The `call_agent` functionality stalls forever on Windows, preventing actual agent execution despite all component tests passing. This is a critical integration issue that requires systematic diagnosis and resolution.

## Problem Statement
- Agent execution hangs indefinitely when using `call_agent`
- End-to-end tests pass but don't catch real agent execution issues
- Need to identify root cause of stalling behavior
- Must implement bulk microtesting to efficiently test all possible solutions

## Scope
### Files to Investigate
- [ ] `app/agent_runner.py` - Core agent execution logic
- [ ] `app/agent_executor.py` - Agent execution orchestration
- [ ] `app/oneshot_mcp.py` - MCP server agent calling
- [ ] `tools/agent_caller.py` - Agent calling tool
- [ ] Process execution patterns in agent workflow
- [ ] I/O buffering and timeout handling
- [ ] Windows-specific subprocess behavior

### Key Areas
1. **Agent Execution Pipeline**
   - Subprocess spawning for agent execution
   - I/O redirection and buffering
   - Process timeout and termination
   
2. **Windows-Specific Issues**
   - Console subsystem differences
   - Process creation flags
   - I/O buffering behavior
   - Shell execution patterns
   
3. **MCP Communication**
   - stdio vs SSE transport issues
   - Message buffering problems
   - Process communication deadlocks

## Technical Requirements
- Identify exact stalling point in agent execution
- Create bulk microtest suite to test all possible solutions
- Implement proper timeout and error handling
- Ensure Windows-specific process handling
- Validate complete agent execution workflow

## Bulk Microtest Strategy
Create ONE comprehensive test script that tests multiple potential solutions:
1. **Process Creation Variations**
   - Different subprocess parameters
   - Various shell execution modes
   - Alternative I/O handling approaches
   
2. **Timeout and Buffer Management**
   - Different timeout values
   - Buffer flushing strategies
   - Non-blocking I/O patterns
   
3. **Windows-Specific Fixes**
   - Process creation flags
   - Console handling options
   - Environment variable configurations

## Test Cases
- [ ] Agent execution completes within reasonable time
- [ ] Process termination works correctly
- [ ] Error messages are captured properly
- [ ] No hanging processes remain
- [ ] Memory and resource cleanup functions

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Create bulk microtest diagnosis script
2. **Phase 2**: Run comprehensive test matrix
3. **Phase 3**: Identify and implement working solution
4. **Phase 4**: Validate fix with real agent execution

## Dependencies
- Path separator handling (subtask 01) - ✅ Completed
- Process execution (subtask 02) - ✅ Completed
- Environment variables (subtask 03) - ✅ Completed
- File permissions (subtask 04) - ✅ Completed

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Multiple potential root causes
  - **Mitigation**: Bulk microtest all possibilities systematically
- **Risk**: Windows-specific debugging complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Test variations of Windows process handling
- **Risk**: Time-consuming trial and error
  - **Mitigation**: Automated test matrix for efficiency
