# Process Execution - Windows Compatibility

## Overview
Replace Unix subprocess calls with Windows-compatible versions throughout the OneShot system.

## Problem Statement
- Current system uses Unix-specific subprocess patterns
- Shell commands assume bash/sh instead of PowerShell/cmd
- Process spawning mechanisms differ between platforms
- Environment variable handling varies between systems

## Scope
### Files to Investigate
- [ ] `app/tool_services.py` - Tool subprocess execution
- [ ] `app/agent_executor.py` - Agent process management
- [ ] `tools/` directory - All tools that spawn processes
- [ ] `tools/bash_tools/` - Shell script replacements needed
- [ ] Local MCP servers - Process startup handling

### Key Areas
1. **Subprocess Call Patterns**
   - Replace shell-specific commands with cross-platform equivalents
   - Handle different shell environments (PowerShell vs bash)
   - Manage process timeouts and error handling
   
2. **Shell Command Translation**
   - Convert bash scripts to PowerShell equivalents
   - Handle command-line argument differences
   - Manage different executable paths and extensions
   
3. **Environment Management**
   - Windows environment variable handling
   - PATH manipulation differences
   - Working directory management

## Technical Requirements
- Use `subprocess.run()` with proper shell parameter handling
- Implement platform detection for command selection
- Handle Windows executable extensions (.exe, .bat, .ps1)
- Manage PowerShell execution policies
- Implement proper timeout and error handling

## Test Cases
- [ ] Tool execution succeeds on Windows
- [ ] MCP server startup works correctly
- [ ] Shell command translation functions properly
- [ ] Process cleanup handles Windows specifics
- [ ] Error messages are meaningful on Windows

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Audit all subprocess usage
2. **Phase 2**: Create cross-platform process utilities
3. **Phase 3**: Replace shell-specific commands
4. **Phase 4**: Test process execution on Windows

## Dependencies
- Path separator handling (subtask 01)

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: PowerShell execution policy restrictions
  - **Mitigation**: Use bypass flags or alternative execution methods
- **Risk**: Different command-line argument escaping
  - **Mitigation**: Use subprocess argument lists instead of shell strings

## Progress Log
| Date | Developer | Action | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 2025-08-24 | AI Agent | Created comprehensive test script | test_process_execution.py - validates subprocess patterns |
| 2025-08-24 | AI Agent | Ran process execution tests | 9/9 tests passed on Windows - subprocess execution works correctly |
| 2025-08-24 | AI Agent | Fixed f-string syntax issue | Resolved backslash escaping in test scripts |
| 2025-08-24 | AI Agent | Validated PowerShell execution | Windows shell commands, PowerShell, and timeouts all work |

## Troubleshooting Notes
### Common Issues
- PowerShell execution policy blocks
- Command not found errors (missing .exe extension)
- Different argument escaping requirements
- Process hanging due to I/O buffering

### Solutions Applied
_To be filled during implementation_
