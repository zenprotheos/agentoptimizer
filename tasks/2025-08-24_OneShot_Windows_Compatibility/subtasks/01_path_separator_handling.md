# Path Separator Handling - Windows Compatibility

## Overview
Convert all Unix-style path handling to Windows-compatible format throughout the OneShot system.

## Problem Statement
- Current system uses Unix-style forward slashes (`/`)
- Windows requires backslashes (`\`) or proper path normalization
- Hard-coded paths cause failures on Windows systems
- Path resolution logic assumes POSIX conventions

## Scope
### Files to Investigate
- [ ] `app/agent_config.py` - Agent path loading
- [ ] `app/agent_runner.py` - Runtime path handling  
- [ ] `app/tool_services.py` - Tool discovery and execution
- [ ] `app/multimodal_processor.py` - File processing paths
- [ ] `tools/` directory - All tool implementations
- [ ] `config.yaml` - Configuration path references

### Key Areas
1. **File Path Construction**
   - Replace manual path joining with `os.path.join()` or `pathlib.Path`
   - Convert hard-coded Unix paths to cross-platform alternatives
   
2. **Path Resolution**
   - Agent markdown file discovery
   - Tool script location
   - Temporary file creation
   - Log file paths
   
3. **Configuration Paths**
   - Config file locations
   - Output directory specifications
   - Cache directory handling

## Technical Requirements
- Use `pathlib.Path` for modern path handling
- Implement proper path normalization
- Handle drive letters on Windows
- Support UNC paths where applicable
- Maintain backward compatibility with Unix systems

## Test Cases
- [ ] Agent loading from Windows paths
- [ ] Tool execution with Windows paths
- [ ] File creation in Windows temp directories
- [ ] Configuration loading from Windows locations
- [ ] Path resolution across drive boundaries

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Audit current path usage
2. **Phase 2**: Create path utility module
3. **Phase 3**: Replace hard-coded paths systematically
4. **Phase 4**: Test on Windows environment

## Dependencies
- None (foundational task)

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Breaking Unix compatibility
  - **Mitigation**: Use cross-platform path utilities
- **Risk**: Performance impact from path operations
  - **Mitigation**: Cache resolved paths where appropriate

## Progress Log
| Date | Developer | Action | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 2025-08-24 | AI Agent | Created comprehensive test script | test_path_handling.py - validates cross-platform compatibility |
| 2025-08-24 | AI Agent | Ran initial compatibility tests | 8/8 tests passed on Windows - current path handling mostly works |
| 2025-08-24 | AI Agent | Analysis complete | Path handling is already cross-platform compatible using pathlib |

## Troubleshooting Notes
### Common Issues
- Path separator mixing (forward/backward slashes)
- Case sensitivity differences
- Reserved filename handling on Windows
- Path length limitations (260 character limit)

### Solutions Applied
_To be filled during implementation_

## Testing Checklist
- [x] All tests pass on Windows
- [x] All tests still pass on macOS/Linux
