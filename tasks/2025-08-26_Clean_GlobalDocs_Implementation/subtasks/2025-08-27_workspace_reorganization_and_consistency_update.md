# üö® **CRITICAL AI REMINDER - READ BEFORE EVERY ACTION** üö®

## üìã **PRIMARY MISSION**
Apply the intelligent workspace organization principles we developed to THIS current workspace and ensure ALL documents are updated and consistent with our latest decisions.

## üéØ **KEY PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER**
1. **Root Folder Limit**: Maximum 4 primary files in root directory
2. **Dynamic Structure**: AI-driven organization, not rigid templates
3. **Modular Checkpoints**: Programmatic validation with Jinja2 integration
4. **Enhanced Snippets**: Checkpoint system lives in `/snippets` with clear organization
5. **Reusable Templates**: Multi-level reusability (global, user, project, session)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY ACTIONS AFTER EACH TASK**
- [ ] **Update This Progress Tracker**: Mark completed items as ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Cross-Reference Check**: Ensure no conflicts with other documents
- [ ] **Consistency Validation**: Verify all documents tell the same story
- [ ] **Documentation Update**: Update master documents with new information
