# Implementation Plan - Cursor Agent Stall Prevention

## Overview
Create comprehensive anti-stall mechanisms to eliminate manual Ctrl+Enter intervention requirements for cursor agent command execution.

## Problem Analysis
Based on investigation of previous Windows compatibility issues, the main stall causes are:

1. **Subprocess Execution Hangs**: Commands hang when executed via `subprocess.run()` 
2. **No Timeout Enforcement**: Many commands lack proper timeout mechanisms
3. **Buffer Blocking**: Large output can cause stdio buffer hangs
4. **Interactive Commands**: Commands waiting for user input without timeouts
5. **Network Operations**: Indefinite waits for network responses

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Command Execution Framework ‚≠ê PRIORITY
- [ ] Create enhanced `run_terminal_cmd` with mandatory timeouts
- [ ] Implement multi-layer timeout protection
- [ ] Add automatic process termination capabilities
- [ ] Create watchdog timer system

### Phase 2: Auto-Recovery Engine
- [ ] Design stall detection algorithms
- [ ] Implement automatic recovery triggers
- [ ] Create Ctrl+Enter simulation mechanism
- [ ] Add graceful continuation logic

### Phase 3: Rule Enhancement
- [ ] Update `coding-tasks.mdc` with mandatory anti-stall protocols
- [ ] Add timeout requirements for all command patterns
- [ ] Create standardized timeout templates
- [ ] Document fallback mechanisms

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Create stall simulation test suite
- [ ] Test timeout enforcement across command types
- [ ] Validate auto-recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Performance and reliability testing

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### 1. Enhanced run_terminal_cmd Tool

#### Core Requirements
```python
class EnhancedTerminalCmd:
    def __init__(self, command, timeout=30, auto_recover=True):
        self.command = command
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.auto_recover = auto_recover
        self.watchdog = None
        
    def execute_with_timeout(self):
        # Multi-layer timeout protection
        # Automatic termination on timeout
        # Auto-recovery trigger
        pass
```

#### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **Command Validation**: Pre-flight checks for known problematic patterns
- [ ] **Timeout Wrapper**: PowerShell job-based timeout mechanism
- [ ] **Process Control**: Force termination capabilities  
- [ ] **Watchdog Timer**: Independent timeout monitoring
- [ ] **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic continuation after timeout
- [ ] **Logging**: Comprehensive timeout event logging

### 2. Timeout Strategy by Command Type

#### Simple Commands (10-30 seconds)
- [ ] File operations, directory listing, basic tools
- [ ] Timeout: 30 seconds default
- [ ] Recovery: Immediate continuation

#### MCP Operations (30-60 seconds)  
- [ ] Agent calls, tool execution, API requests
- [ ] Timeout: 60 seconds default
- [ ] Recovery: Log timeout and continue with fallback

#### Heavy Operations (60-90 seconds)
- [ ] Large file processing, network downloads, builds
- [ ] Timeout: 90 seconds maximum
- [ ] Recovery: Graceful cleanup and continuation

### 3. PowerShell Integration Patterns

#### Template 1: Job-Based Timeout
```powershell
$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock { <COMMAND> }
if (Wait-Job $job -Timeout <TIMEOUT>) {
    Receive-Job $job
} else {
    Stop-Job $job -Force
    throw "Command timed out - auto-recovering"
}
```

#### Template 2: Process-Based Timeout  
```powershell
$psi = New-Object System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo
$psi.UseShellExecute = $false
$p = [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start($psi)
if (!$p.WaitForExit(<TIMEOUT_MS>)) {
    $p.Kill()
    throw "Process timeout - auto-recovering"
}
```

#### Template 3: Background Execution
```powershell
# For commands that should run in background
Start-Process -NoNewWindow -PassThru <COMMAND>
# Monitor with timeout and auto-terminate if needed
```

### 4. Auto-Recovery Mechanisms

#### Recovery Strategies
- [ ] **Graceful Termination**: Send termination signals before force kill
- [ ] **State Preservation**: Maintain execution context across timeouts
- [ ] **Continuation Logic**: Resume agent workflow automatically
- [ ] **Error Reporting**: Log timeout events without stopping execution

#### Fallback Actions
- [ ] **Alternative Commands**: Try simpler alternatives for failed operations
- [ ] **Skip Operations**: Continue with non-critical command failures
- [ ] **User Notification**: Inform about timeouts without requiring intervention
- [ ] **Retry Logic**: Intelligent retry for transient failures

## Integration with Existing Systems

### 1. Windows Compatibility Rules
- [ ] Integrate with existing `.cursor/rules/cursor-windows-rule.mdc`
- [ ] Maintain compatibility with PowerShell execution patterns
- [ ] Preserve environment variable handling
- [ ] Keep temp file management protocols

### 2. MCP Protocol Compliance
- [ ] Ensure MCP tool call compatibility
- [ ] Maintain JSON-RPC response formatting
- [ ] Preserve error handling conventions
- [ ] Keep tool parameter validation

### 3. Agent Execution Flow
- [ ] Integrate with agent runner timeouts
- [ ] Maintain subprocess execution patterns
- [ ] Preserve agent communication protocols
- [ ] Keep execution context management

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Stall Simulation Tests
```python
# Test cases for common stall patterns
test_infinite_loop_command()
test_network_timeout_command()  
test_interactive_input_command()
test_large_output_command()
test_subprocess_hang_command()
```

### 2. Timeout Validation Tests
```python
# Validate timeout enforcement
test_command_timeout_enforcement()
test_auto_termination_mechanisms()
test_recovery_continuation()
test_performance_impact()
```

### 3. Integration Tests  
```python
# End-to-end workflow tests
test_agent_execution_with_timeouts()
test_mcp_tool_timeout_handling()
test_multi_command_sequence_recovery()
test_error_state_recovery()
```

## Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- [ ] **Zero Manual Intervention**: No more Ctrl+Enter requirements
- [ ] **100% Timeout Coverage**: All commands have timeout protection
- [ ] **Auto-Recovery Rate**: > 95% successful auto-recovery
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: < 5% overhead for normal operations

### Secondary Goals  
- [ ] **False Positive Rate**: < 1% incorrect timeout triggers
- [ ] **Recovery Time**: < 5 seconds average recovery time
- [ ] **Compatibility**: 100% backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] **Reliability**: > 99% successful command execution

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
- [ ] **Over-aggressive Timeouts**: Commands terminated too early
- [ ] **Recovery Failures**: Auto-recovery doesn't work correctly
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Timeout mechanisms slow down execution
- [ ] **Compatibility Issues**: Breaks existing command patterns

### Mitigation Strategies
- [ ] **Graduated Timeouts**: Start with conservative timeouts, adjust based on data
- [ ] **Recovery Testing**: Comprehensive testing of recovery mechanisms
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Measure and optimize timeout overhead
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain fallback to existing patterns
