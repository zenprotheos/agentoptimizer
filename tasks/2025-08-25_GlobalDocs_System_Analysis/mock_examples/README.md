# Mock Examples - Hybrid Template+AI Organization System

## Overview

This directory demonstrates how the hybrid template+AI system works in practice with **real mock files and content**. It shows:

1. **Session Organization**: How different session types are detected and organized
2. **Project Promotion**: How sessions evolve into structured projects
3. **Hardcoded vs Dynamic**: What's template-driven vs AI-generated
4. **SOP Clarification**: Programming troubleshooting uses same SOP as coding development

## Key Clarification: SOP Alignment

✅ **NOTED**: Coding development and programming-related troubleshooting both use the **same 7-step SOP workflow**. The system will detect programming troubleshooting and route it to the coding development template.

```

## How to Use This Example

1. **Review Session Examples**: See how different content types are organized
2. **Check Project Promotion**: Understand session → project evolution
3. **Understand Decision Logic**: See when templates vs AI are used
4. **Identify Fixed vs Flexible**: Know what you can modify vs what's determined by AI

Each example includes **detailed annotations** explaining whether content is:
- 🔧 **HARDCODED**: Fixed template structure (predictable)
- 🤖 **AI-GENERATED**: Dynamic content organization (creative)
- ⚙️ **HYBRID**: Template structure + AI content analysis

## New: Jinja2 Template Examples

The `jinja2_template_examples/` directory demonstrates **context optimization patterns** based on insights from the parallel Jinja2 exploration:

### **Key Features Demonstrated**
- ✅ **Intelligent File Selection**: Smart handling of large file sets (90%+ token reduction)
- ✅ **Index-First Strategy**: Leverages existing `build-index.cjs` for session-level indexing
- ✅ **Adaptive Templates**: Different strategies for small vs large file sets
- ✅ **Context Efficiency**: Practical examples of token optimization

### **Integration Benefits**
- **Reusable**: Uses existing OneShot Jinja2 infrastructure
- **Scalable**: Handles 20+ files per session efficiently
- **Transparent**: Clear selection rationale for users
- **Backward Compatible**: Falls back gracefully for small sessions

These examples show how the proposed hybrid system achieves intelligent context management while preserving OneShot's existing architecture! 🎯
